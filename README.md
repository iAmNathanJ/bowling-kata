# Bowling Kata

Solutions 1 & 2 were worked out before reading [this](http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/index.pl/index.pl?KataBowling). They are left unfinished, as my attempts were heavy handed. Solution 3 is my final kata.

Solution 2 assumes a more complete data/frame set to work with. If I were building this in real life, I believe this would be more appropriate.
